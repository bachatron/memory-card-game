# Pokémon Memory Card Game

This is a simple memory card game built with **React + Vite** as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

The game uses a **Pokémon API theme**, where players must click unique cards without repeating. Each time you click a card, the cards shuffle.

## Features

- Built with **React + Vite**
- Dynamic difficulty selection (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- Modern clean UI
- Pokémon artwork from the API
- Game Over and You Win modals

## Future Improvements

- Allow selecting **custom difficulty**
- Add **complete Pokédex mode** with all 898+ Pokémon

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
